/// @title EEZ
/// @notice L1 contract managing rollup state roots, multi-prover batch posting, and cross-chain call execution
/// @dev EARLY-STAGE IMPLEMENTATION — NOT PRODUCTION READY.
///      This is a first implementation of the sync-rollups protocol. It has NOT undergone an
///      external security audit. Interfaces, storage layout, error semantics, and execution
///      flow are expected to change in the near term as design issues are fixed and the
///      protocol is iterated on. Do not rely on this code for value-bearing deployments,
///      and do not treat its current behavior as the canonical specification.
/// @dev Execution entries are posted via `postAndVerifyBatch(batch)`,
///      attested by ≥ threshold proof systems per rollup. Atomic verification: if any single
///      proof fails, the whole batch reverts.
///
///      The batch's leading `transientExecutionEntryCount` entries are loaded into
///      `_transientExecutions` (semantically transient, cleared at end of every batch). The
///      leading run of those entries with `proxyEntryHash == 0` runs inline as "immediate"
///      entries (state deltas + flat calls + rolling hash, one `_applyAndExecute` cycle per
///      entry). Then `IMetaCrossChainReceiver(msg.sender).executeMetaCrossChainTransactions()`
///      is invoked (when msg.sender has code) so the caller can drive the remaining transient
///      entries via cross-chain proxy calls within the same transaction.
///
///      The batch remainder (entries past `transientExecutionEntryCount`) is published into
///      per-rollup queues keyed by `destinationRollupId` UNCONDITIONALLY — even if the meta
///      hook left transient entries unconsumed. Soundness backstop: every entry's
///      `StateDelta.currentState` is checked at consumption time, so any persistent entry
///      whose preconditions were lost with the dropped transient leftover simply fails its
///      `StateRootMismatch` check.
///
///      Deferred consumption: `executeCrossChainCall` (proxy entry) and `executeL2TX(rid)` route
///      to `verificationByRollup[rid].executionQueue[cursor]` and advance the per-rollup cursor.
