//  IEEZL2 — L2 (EEZL2) execution structs.
//
//  L2 uses SELF-RELATIVE directional names, mirroring L1's directional style
//  (L1: `l2ToL1Calls` / `expectedL1ToL2Calls`). An L2's cross-chain counterparty
//  can be ANY rollup — L1 (mainnet) OR another L2 — so absolute names like
//  `l1ToL2Calls` would bake in a direction that is frequently wrong. Naming the
//  direction relative to THIS chain stays correct for every counterparty:
//    - an `incomingCalls[]` entry is a cross-chain call executed ON this L2 on
//      behalf of a remote caller (delivered through the caller's proxy). The
//      flat array is walked by the `_currentIncomingCall` cursor.
//    - an `expectedOutgoingCalls[]` entry is the pre-computed result of a
//      reentrant cross-chain call fired FROM this L2 toward a remote rollup
//      during execution (counted by the `_lastOutgoingCallConsumed` cursor).
//
//  Deliberately LEANER than L1's structs: L2 has a single rollup, no state deltas,
//  and no per-rollup queue interleaving, so the L1-only fields are dropped entirely
//  (no `StateDelta`, `destinationRollupId`, or `ExpectedStateRootPerRollup`). L2
//  never hashes a whole entry/lookup, so its layout is free to diverge from L1's.
//
//  Casing: types/events/errors are PascalCase (`CrossChainCall`, `OutgoingCallConsumed`,
//  `UnconsumedOutgoingCalls`); variables / struct fields / params are mixedCase
//  (`incomingCalls`, `expectedOutgoingCalls`, `_currentIncomingCall`).

///        - `expectedOutgoingCalls[i].callCount` = iterations the i-th reentrant frame's `_processNCalls` runs.
///      And the invariant after the entry finishes:
///        callCount + Σ expectedOutgoingCalls[i].callCount == incomingCalls.length
///      The on-chain `_currentIncomingCall` cursor advances monotonically over `incomingCalls[]` —
///      there's only one cursor across the whole tree. When a top-level call triggers a reentrant
///      cross-chain proxy invocation, control re-enters via `executeCrossChainCall`
///      → `_consumeNestedAction`, which calls `_processNCalls(expectedOutgoingCalls[i].callCount)`
///      on the SAME `incomingCalls[]` array, advancing the same cursor. Outer iteration resumes
///      where the cursor left off after the reentrant frame returns.
///
///      Worked example. `incomingCalls.length = 5`:
///        - call 0: top-level, no reentry.
